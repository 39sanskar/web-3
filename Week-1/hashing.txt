Hashing is a process that transforms input data (of any size) into a fixed-size string of characters.

Hash functions have several important properties:

1. Deterministic: The same input will always produce the same output.
2. Fast computation: The hash value can be quickly computed for any given data.

3. Pre-image resistance: It should be computationally infeasible to reverse the hash function (i.e., find the original input given its hash output).

4. Small changes in input produce large changes in output: Even a tiny change in the input should drastically change the hash output.

5. Collision resistance: It should be computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output.


Is this a hashing algorithm?

What if I try “hashing” a string by increasing each alphabet’s value by one.
Do you think this follows all the rules we’ve written above?
